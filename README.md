A Study of Kaggle Seattle AirBnB Dataset

This study of AirBnB dataset is used to predict prices and features influencing the prices. Along with that, a study on the season time to travel to Seattle and response rates of the Listings were discussed and also the factors influencing the Review score were also studied.

A Brief report of the project is present at https://medium.com/p/dd9d68bde062/.

The Folder structure has
1. Images - All the images used to create reports
2. Seattle.ipynb - Notebook file for the code
3. seattle.zip - It's a Kaggle dataset for Seattle AirBnB and Kaggle owns the right.

Also, as a part of Udacity Nanodegree on Data Science project, I have to answer three questions.
1. How and what are the features influence on prices of the stay?
2. What is the optimum Season to visit and how the response rates of the owners vary in different seasons?
3. What are the factors influencing the review scores?

The fundamental idea of the code is inspired from the work of https://www.kaggle.com/aleksandradeis/airbnb-seattle-reservation-prices-analysis.
