A Study of Kaggle Seattle AirBnB Dataset

### Libraries
1.Numpy

2.Pandas

3.Scikit

4.Matplotlib

### Motivation

This study of AirBnB dataset is used to predict prices and features influencing the prices. Along with that, a study on the season time to travel to Seattle and response rates of the Listings were discussed and also the factors influencing the Review score were also studied.

Also, as a part of Udacity Nanodegree on Data Science project, I have to answer three questions.
1. How and what are the features influence on prices of the stay?
2. What is the optimum Season to visit and how the response rates of the owners vary in different seasons?
3. What are the factors influencing the review scores?

A Brief report of the project is present at https://medium.com/p/dd9d68bde062/.

### The Folder structure
1. Images - All the images used to create reports
2. Seattle.ipynb - Notebook file for the code
3. seattle.zip - It's a Kaggle dataset for Seattle AirBnB and Kaggle owns the right.

### Results
1. The Main features that influence the price are bathrooms, bedrooms, accommodates, number of reviews, season of travel, neighborhood Downtown
2. It seems winter is the peak season to visit Seattle as the number of listings and their prices grow up
3. The major factors that influence the review scores considered are amenities, if a host is a superhost and the cancellation policies. However the main observation is these factors might not be directly influential in low score but when scores are high, these factors tend to grow up.

### Acknowledgements
The fundamental idea of the code is inspired from the work of https://www.kaggle.com/aleksandradeis/airbnb-seattle-reservation-prices-analysis.
